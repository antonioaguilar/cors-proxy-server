  <h3>Proxy Server Usage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">/</a> Shows help</li>
    <li><a href="/iscorsneeded">/iscorsneeded</a> This is the only resource on this host which is served without CORS headers.</li>
    <li><a href="/url">/url</a> Create a request to url, and includes CORS headers in the response.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the protocol is omitted, it defaults to http (https if port 443 is specified).</p>
  <p>Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests.</p>

  <p>
    Redirects are automatically followed. For debugging purposes, each followed redirect results in the addition of a X-CORS-Redirect-n header, where n starts at 1. These headers are not accessible by the XMLHttpRequest API.
  </p>

  <p>
    After 5 redirects, redirects are not followed any more. The redirect response is sent back to the browser, which can choose to follow the redirect (handled automatically by the browser).
  </p>

  <p>
    The requested URL is available in the X-Request-URL response header. The final URL, after following all redirects, is available in the X-Final-URL response header.
  </p>

  <p>
    To prevent the use of the proxy for casual browsing, the API requires either the Origin or the X-Requested-With header to be set. To avoid unnecessary preflight (OPTIONS) requests, it's recommended to not manually set these headers in your code.
